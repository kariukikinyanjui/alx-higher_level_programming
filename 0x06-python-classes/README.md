In Python, classes and objects are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). They allow you to create structured and organized code by defining blueprints for objects and creating instances of those objects based on those blueprints.

Class: A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that the objects of that class will have. Classes provide a way to encapsulate data and behavior together.

Object: An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete realization of the blueprint defined by the class. Objects have attributes that store data and methods that operate on that data.
