A high-level programming language is one that is designed to be easy for humans to read and write, abstracting away many low-level details of the computer's hardware and operation. This makes high-level languages like Python more user-friendly and efficient for software development.

Python is a versatile and popular programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It's widely used in various fields such as web development, data science, machine learning, scientific research, automation, and more.
