In Python, a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py added.

Modules can contain functions, classes, and variables that can be used in other programs. They provide a way to organize your code into reusable and logically grouped components.

In Python, the import keyword is used to bring external modules or packages into your current script or program. When you import a module, you gain access to the functions, classes, and variables defined in that module, allowing you to use them in your code.
